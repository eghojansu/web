# web
eghojansu/moe web implementation

> It was create to fill author needs

## The Goal
I want to develop new web easily. I just love [Fatfree Framework](http://fatfreeframework.com) and I turn it into [eghojansu/moe](http://github.com/eghojansu/moe) then I create this repository.

May be this is a stupid way to develop a web application. But I don't know the 'perfect' way to build it from scratch.
